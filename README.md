## so like, an about me?
building things with heart, juggling a dozen ideas at once, and somehow making it all work.
trying to find my niche in tech, so i’m building, learning, and doing a little bit of everything.
i care about sustainability, relatability, and building with empathy—tech that actually helps, not just impresses.
it’s a bit chaotic, but it’s all heart.

currently split between:
- building random projects at 2am (productivity peaks at ungodly hours)
- learning React properly, not just vibe coding and hoping it works
- convincing people to join my chaotic but somehow functional project teams
- attempting to maintain a sleep schedule (failing spectacularly)

## my brain, visualized:

```mermaid
pie title what occupies my thoughts
    "Project ideas" : 30
    "Coffee" : 20
    "Wondering if my code will work" : 20
    "Planning world domination" : 10
    "Actual sleep" : 5
    "MusicDanceBooksMoviesetcetc": 15
```

## stuff i've built when inspiration struck:
- Boba → made this because proximity based chatting made sense at the time
- Spill the tea → started at a hackathon, we gotta edit that more, but the UI for that is litttt!!!
- Lifelist → it's a work in progress don't @ me

## me vs. projects:

```mermaid

    title My Project Timeline vs Reality
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Timeline
    Initial Excitement           :a1, 2023-01-01, 7d
    Actual Coding                :a2, after a1, 14d
    "This is impossible"         :a3, after a2, 5d
    Breakthrough at 3am          :a4, after a3, 1d
    Somehow it works             :a5, after a4, 3d
```
